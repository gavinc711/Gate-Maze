Gate Maze was my first project in a Game Production course, where each of us, on our own, had to create a small game in the Bitsy engine from itch.io.
The engine was limited, and only had so many assets to use, but I squeezed as much creativity out as I could while avoiding the creation of new assets to keep things simple.
There are two versions, one that was created as a first draft, Gate Maze 1, and the other as a final version, Gate Maze 2.
